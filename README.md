# 🐍 SnakeAI: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Snake Game

*A high-performance DQN agent achieving superhuman performance in the classic Snake game*

## 🏆 Project Highlights

**🎯 Peak Performance:** AI agent achieved a **maximum score of 25** (97+ reward points)  
**⚡ Smart Reward Design:** Advanced step penalty system optimizing for efficiency over survival  
**🔬 Rigorous Analysis:** Comprehensive comparison of reward structures with statistical validation

## 🧠 Intelligent Reward System

This project implements a sophisticated reward structure that goes beyond simple survival:

- **🍎 Fruit Collection:** +5 points per fruit
- **💀 Game Over:** -10 points (intelligent failure penalty)  
- **⏱️ Step Efficiency:** Configurable step penalties (-0.01, -0.05) to encourage optimal paths
- **🏅 Victory Bonus:** +100 points for filling the board

### Key Insight: Step Penalties Drive Intelligence

My analysis revealed that **step penalties fundamentally change agent behavior**, creating more intelligent and efficient gameplay:

## 📊 Performance Analysis

| Penalty Type | Mean Reward | Max Reward | Efficiency (Fruit/Step) |
|:-------------|------------:|-----------:|------------------------:|
| **None**     | 17.08       | 95         | 0.0647                  |
| **-0.01**    | 12.72       | **97.08**  | 0.0605                  |
| **-0.05**    | 12.71       | 91.65      | **0.0749**              |

**Key Findings:**
- No penalty achieves highest average reward through longer survival
- -0.01 penalty produces the highest peak performance (**25 fruit collected!**)
- -0.05 penalty creates the most efficient gameplay (highest fruit/step ratio)
